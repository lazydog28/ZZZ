::: warning
The content of this article is more based on users who have a certain foundation for a computer, If you don't understand the computer. It is recommended to directly use the tutorial to [Quick Start](deploy.md). Here is a high-level option. Some improvement of experience
:::

## 1 Use Conda Environment

### 1.1 Download Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sMythicalBird/ZenlessZoneZero-Auto.git
cd ZenlessZoneZero-Auto
```
::: warning
`GPU Version` And `cpu version` choice one，`GPU version` premise that you use the NVIDIA graphics card on your computer
:::
### 1.2 Install Conda

`Conda` Divided into `Anaconda` and `Miniconda`, `Anaconda` is a collection version containing many commonly used libraries. [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)

![Conda](/image/Conda.png)

Check whether the installation is successful

```bash
conda --version
```

### 1.3 Create Conda Environment

1. Open `Anaconda Prompt`
2. Set the mirror source

```bash
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge/
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes
```

3. Create an environment（`Python 3.10`）

```bash
conda create -n py310 python=3.10
```

4. Look at the environment
```bash
conda env list
```

5. Active environment
```bash
conda activate py310
```

### 1.4 Installation related dependencies

::: tabs#conda

@tab GPU Version#GPU
```bash
# Set the mirror source tsinghua.edu
pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# Install cudatoolkit
conda install cudatoolkit=11.8
# Install cudnn
conda install cudnn=8.9.7.29
# Install GPU dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dml.txt
```

@tab CPU Version#CPU
```bash
# 设置镜像源为 清华源
pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# 安装 CPU 依赖
pip install -r requirements-cpu.txt
```
:::

### 1.5 Precautions

1. GPU, CPU Two Select One
2. The GPU installation `CUDATOOLKIT` and `CUDNN` strictly follow the tutorial, using other versions problems **are not responsible for**
3. After the installation, you can run the script with the environment variable in the `Conda`
```bash
python main.py
```
4. If the computer has been installed before this tutorial, the following errors appear when running the script
```bash
ImportError: DLL load failed while importing onnxruntime_pybind_state: 动态链接库（DLL）初始化例程失败
```
Please run the following instructions
```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime-gpu
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.17
```

If the display `Wrapper Sate` shows the uncomfortable or displayed `[not supported]` The configuration file of the patch does not have the corresponding version configuration at this time, we need to update the configuration file

First open `cmd` as an administrator, enter the following commands to stop `termservice`

```bash
net stop termservice
```

Then use the text editor to open the `C:\Program Files\RDPWrapper\rdpwrap.ini` Configuration file, copy the content in the [rdpwrap.ini](https://github.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap.ini/blob/master/rdpwrap.ini) to the above configuration file` rdpwrap.ini`

At this time, reopen the `rdpconf.exe` file should be all green

If there is still a red error, enter the folder after the patch decompressing, open the terminal, and enter the following command to restart the service

```bash
