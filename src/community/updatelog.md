::: details 2.2 Optimization content
1. The model adds the recognition of the conveyor belt. The map search algorithm is redesigned. The core of the train can automatically find the road normally
2. Optimized the movement speed of the mode 2, 3, and 4 on the second floor, and shorten the overall process
3. The full model will give priority to finding two teammates, and increase the selection of the emblem in an appropriate amount to ensure that they will not be killed (developers can be played. Others can't fight again, first reflect on whether they are so fun)
4. Added independent judgment of some events
5. Optimized the steering design of the running map during the battle phase
6. Fix the bug of some scripts running

::: details 2.1 Optimization content
1. Model selection adds the choice of performance banking together
2. The combat module is independent, adding the judgment of the joint skills, the judgment of the current battlefield character
3. The combat logic of some characters is added, and the corresponding logic will be called during the battle during the battle.
4. The probability of a lattice misjudgment when the search path is reduced
5. Fix a few bugs
